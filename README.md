## Pentesting Report

1.Legacy Theme Preview Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: One of the callback functions remove the potential for JavaScript to be executed, it removes "onclick='", but continues to run the request without the "onclick='" function. We can use "onmouseover" after the "onclick=" function is removed, allowing us to use XSS. You do have to be an admin to be able to run this, but if you can get the admin to click a malicious link beforehand, it will work.
    - Vulnerability types: XSS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.4
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: 
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: Once you have your script ready, post it as a comment on any post on a WordPress page. Once the comment is posted, either scroll up for the script to be activated, or refresh the page and it will activate.
